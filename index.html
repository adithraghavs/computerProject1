      <h1>Why iOS is better than Android</h1><br>
      <hr><br>
      <p>
        A lot of people like Android better, and many like iOS better. Android
        has its own very strong points, but there are some things thaat make iOS
        better and iOS apps easier to develop.
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          Companies that use Android release something like a thousand phones a
          year. This makes it really difficult for developers to develop apps
          for these phones.
        </li>
        <li>
          Different phones usually use different chips, and it is nearly
          impossible for anyone to develop apps for every single Android phone
          chip.
        </li>
        <li>
          iOS is updated regularly. So even if you have a 4 year old iPhone, you
          can still get the latest release of iOS. But if Google releases a new
          version of Android, many Android manufacturers won't jump on the
          bandwagon and upgrade all their devices. Each phone manufacturers want
          their phone to have some unique features, so the tweaking of the OS
          will take some time, causing a massive delay.
        </li>
        <li>
          There have been instances where ANdroid has been hacked info and
          sometimes the biometric info of users such as fingerprint and face has
          been stolen.
        </li>
        <li>
          On the other hand, iOS does not store your data on a server in the
          cloud, but it is stored locally. And that is why there is almost a 0%
          chance that iOS can get hacked into.
        </li>
